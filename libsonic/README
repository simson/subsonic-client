INSTALL
-------------

Installation is fairly simple.  Just do the standard install as root:

# tar -xvzf py-sonic-*.tar.gz
# cd py-sonic-*
# python setup.py install

-------------
USAGE
-------------

This library follows the REST API almost exactly (for now).  If you follow the 
documentation on http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp or you do a:

$ pydoc libsonic.connection

-------------
BASIC TUTORIAL 
-------------

This is about as basic as it gets.  We are just going to set up the connection
and then get a couple of random songs.

-------------
#!/usr/bin/env python

from pprint import pprint
import libsonic

# We pass in the base url, the username, password, and port number
# Be sure to use https:// if this is an ssl connection!
conn = libsonic.Connection('https://music.example.com' , 'myuser' , 
    'secretpass' , port=443)
# Let's get 2 completely random songs
songs = conn.getRandomSongs(size=2)
# We'll just pretty print the results we got to the terminal
pprint(songs)
-------------

As you can see, it's really pretty simple.  If you use the documentation 
provided in the library:

$ pydoc libsonic.connection

or the api docs on subsonic.org (listed above), you should be able to make use
of your server without too much trouble.

Right now, only plain old dictionary structures are returned.  The plan for 
0.2 includes the following:

* Proper object representations for Artist, Album, Song, etc.
* Lazy access of members (the song objects aren't created until you want to
  do something with them)

-------------
TODO
-------------

In the future, I would like to make this a little more "pythonic" and add
some classes to wrap up the data returned from the server.  Right now, the data
is just returned in the form of a dict, but I would like to have actual
Song, Album, Folder, etc. classes instead, or at least an alternative.  For
now, it works.
